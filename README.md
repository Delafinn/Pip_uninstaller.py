# Pip_uninstaller.py
remove all pip packages besides "pip" and "setuptools"


When you install Python using the official Python distribution, `pip` and `setuptools` are included as default packages. These are essential packages that allow you to manage and install additional Python packages.

Here's a list of default packages typically included with `pip`:

-   ``pip``: The package installer for Python. It is used to install, upgrade, and manage Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package repositories.
-   ``setuptools``: A package that provides the necessary tools for building and distributing Python packages. It includes functionality for defining package metadata, creating setup scripts, and managing dependencies.

These two packages are considered part of the Python packaging ecosystem and are generally installed by default when you set up Python on your system.
